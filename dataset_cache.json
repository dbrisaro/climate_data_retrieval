Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice thickness is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice, alongside sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.\nSatellite radar altimeters provide measurements of the sea ice freeboard, which is the difference between the height of the surface of sea ice and the surface of water in open leads (areas of open water within the sea ice). Because of the buoyancy of ice in water, typically about 90% of the ice thickness remains under water and thus the total ice thickness is about 10 times the freeboard. However, snow on top of sea ice changes this ratio and complicates the estimation of the ice thickness, requiring the use of auxiliary information about snow depth and density. The retrieval of ice thickness uses the narrow radar swath at the nadir of the satellite at full resolution of approximately 1-10 km and a point spacing of 300 meters. This Level-2 sea-ice thickness products (not provided here) is then gridded for a period of a month to obtain full coverage of a north polar grid at a resolution of 25 km. The algorithm used was developed as part of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) on Sea Ice.\nThe data provided here are Level-3 Collated (L3C) products: they contain monthly gridded values from orbit data from a single platform (Envisat or CryoSat-2) without interpolation or any other form of gap filling. The files also contain estimates of the algorithm uncertainty as well as a quality status flag indicating potential issues with the retrieval not captured in the algorithm uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty in the algorithm are related to the auxiliary data and to the use of different radar altimeter concepts in Envisat (pulse-limited) and CryoSat-2 (synthetic aperture radar).\nThis dataset combines a Climate Data Record (CDR), which has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and change, and an Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR), which provides regular temporal extensions to the CDR and where consistency with the CDR is expected but not extensively checked. Here, the CDR is based on measurements from the RA-2 altimeter on Envisat (October 2002  to October 2010) and the SIRAL altimeter on CryoSat-2 (November 2010 to April 2020). The ICDR is based on observations from CryoSat-2 only (from April 2015 onward) and is updated monthly with a one-month delay behind real time. Users should note that the quality and accuracy of the data record are higher during the CryoSat-2 period than during the Envisat period. As a result, care should be taken when combining the two missions to assess long-term changes and trends. More information can be found in the Product User Guide and Product Quality Assessment Report.\nThis dataset is currently limited spatially to the Arctic region and temporally to the winter months of October through April due to unresolved bias originating from melting snow or open melt ponds in the remaining five months. For a similar reason, no sea-ice thickness data with sufficient quality exist for the Southern Hemisphere. The extension of the CDR/ICDR to other periods, regions, and radar altimeter missions is under development in the extension of the ESA CCI Sea Ice project (ESA CCI+).\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)."}, "satellite-sea-ice-edge-type": {"title": "Sea ice edge and type daily gridded data from 1978 to present derived from satellite observations", "description": "This dataset provides daily gridded data of sea ice edge and sea ice type derived from brightness temperatures measured by satellite passive microwave radiometers.

Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice edge and type are some of the parameters used to characterise sea ice. Other parameters include sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness, also available in the Climate Data Store.\nSea ice edge and type are defined as follows:\n\nSea ice edge classifies the sea surface into open water, open ice, and closed ice depending on the amount of sea ice present in each grid cell. This variable is provided for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Note that a sea ice concentration threshold of 30% is used to distinguish between open water and open ice, which differs from the 15% threshold commonly used for other sea ice products such as sea ice extent.\nSea ice type classifies ice-covered areas into two categories based on the age of the sea ice: multiyear ice versus seasonal first-year ice. This variable is currently only available for the Northern Hemisphere and limited to the extended boreal winter months (October through April). Sea ice type classification during summer is difficult due to the effect of melting at the ice surface which disturbs the passive microwave signature.\n\nBoth sea ice products are based on measurements from the series of Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sensors and share the same algorithm baseline. However, sea ice edge makes use of two lower frequencies near 19 GHz and 37 GHz and a higher frequency near 90 GHz whereas sea ice type only uses the two lower frequencies. This dataset combines Climate Data Records (CDRs), which are intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to assess climate variability and change, and Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which provide regular temporal extensions to the CDRs and where consistency with the CDRs is expected but not extensively checked.

In the following, it is referred to as the SSMIS product.\nThe Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Phase 2 project (ESA CCI). This is a medium-resolution product based on measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor (2002\u20132011) and its successor, AMSR2 (2012\u20132017). This product spans the 2002\u20132017 period and is not updated. In the following, it is referred to as the AMSR product.\n\nBoth products are provided on the same polar projection with a grid resolution of 25 km. However, the AMSR product has a true spatial resolution (as resolved by the sensor) of about 15\u201325 km versus 30\u201360 km for the SSMIS product. Therefore, the AMSR product provides a much more detailed view of the sea ice cover than the SSMIS product, especially along the marginal ice zone, the transitional zone between open water and the dense sea ice pack. On the other hand, the clear strength of the SSMIS product is its more than 40-year long and consistent record with daily updates.\nAlthough originating from different projects, the two products share the same algorithm baseline, which is both a continuation of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF approach and a series of innovations contributed mostly by ESA CCI activities. For both products, the underlying algorithm makes use of a combination of the same three temperature channels near 19 GHz and 37 GHz. The data also share a common data format so that interested users can revert some of the filtering steps and access the raw output of the SIC algorithms.

FireCCI v5.1cds used a more mature algorithm than the previous version. This algorithm was adapted to Sentinel-3 OLCI data to create the C3S v1.0 burned area product, extending the BA database to the present.\nDuring July 2020, an error in some files in the version v5.1cds were identified, affecting the files of the grid product of January 2018, and the pixel and grid products of October, November and December 2019.

In case that this occurs users are notified.\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article.\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 monthly mean data on pressure levels from 1940 to present\"."}, "satellite-earth-radiation-budget": {"title": "Earth's radiation budget from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations", "description": "The Earth\u2019s Radiation Budget (ERB) represents the overall balance between incoming and outgoing radiant energy at the Earth\u2019s top-of-the-atmosphere. This Essential Climate Variable (ECV) is the primary forcing of the climate system and is therefore a fundamental quantity to be monitored to understand the Earth\u2019s climate and its variability. The ERB comprises the quantification of the incoming radiation from the Sun and the outgoing reflected shortwave and emitted longwave radiation.\nThe ERB represents the balance between incoming, predominantly solar, radiation and outgoing radiation as either reflected solar radiation or thermal radiation emitted by the Earth system. The Earth is in a state of dynamic radiative balance, energy arriving from the Sun is balanced by outgoing radiation from the top-of-the-atmosphere. Changes in the Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere (including cloud amount and properties, and concentrations of greenhouse gases) will alter the radiative balance of the Earth system and change the balance and distribution of outgoing thermal radiation and reflected solar radiation. Aside from the elevation (height) of the sun above the horizon, the largest factor controlling the variability in the Earth's radiation budget is cloud cover; the fraction of cloud cover, their height and opacity all impact on both the reflected solar and outgoing infrared radiation. Thus, knowledge of cloud properties, along with atmospheric composition and surface properties, allows the earth radiation budget to be computed. \nThis catalogue entry comprises data from  a number of origins which are summarised in the following sections."}, "satellite-ocean-colour": {"title": "Ocean colour daily data from 1997 to present derived from satellite observations", "description": "This dataset provides global daily estimates of ocean surface chlorophyll-a concentration and remote sensing reflectance derived from multiple satellite sensors. These two products are part of the broader discipline of ocean colour remote sensing, which analyses ocean surface radiances measured from space to derive information about the optical properties and constituents of the upper ocean. This information plays an essential role in our ability to monitor the health and productivity of marine ecosystems, assess the role of the oceans in the global carbon cycle, and quantify the impacts of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is the only method for regular monitoring of ocean biology on a global scale.\nRemote-sensing reflectance (or Rrs) is defined as the ratio of water-leaving radiance to downwelling irradiance and serves as the main input to algorithms used to derive other ocean colour products. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the main photosynthetic pigment found in phytoplankton, which form the base of the marine food-web and are responsible for approximately half of global photosynthesis. Chl-a can be estimated from Rrs data using different algorithms (see details in the Documentation). Here, we provide a blended Chl-a estimate from multiple algorithms, where blending is based on the suitability of each candidate algorithm to the optical typology of a given pixel. This approach provides the best estimates of global Chl-a across a range of water types.\nThe files from this dataset contain global daily composites of merged sensor products: SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS Aqua, VIIRS, and (from version 5.0 onward) OLCI. Note that Rrs and Chl-a data are only available over cloud- and ice-free areas. As a result, more complete spatial coverage (as shown in the map in the upper-right corner) can be achieved by aggregating data over longer time periods.\nThis dataset is produced using the processing chain software developed by the Ocean Colour component of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative project (ESA OC-CCI).

Ozone is naturally formed in the atmosphere through the interaction between molecular oxygen and solar radiation. In the stratosphere, it acts as a shield protecting us from the UV radiation emitted by the Sun. At ground level however, it is a human health irritant and a component of smog. Ozone and climate change are strongly related. \nThe ozone abundance in the atmosphere can be measured from space using a number of different remote-sensing techniques relying on ozone absorption at UV, visible, infrared and millimeter wavelengths. Instruments use the solar light or the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth to derive the vertical distribution of ozone in nadir, limb and solar occultation observation geometries. In the measured signal, molecular absorption features characteristic of ozone are detected using appropriate retrieval algorithms and are used to quantify its abundance. \nData are available as Level-3 and/or Level-4 data products. Level-3 data correspond to measurements provided on a regular latitude/longitude after re-gridding of level-2 data (satellite orbit tracks) and averaging in time (over a month). Level-4 products are generated from Level-2 data after assimilation in a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model.\nWe distinguish between Climate Data Record (CDR) and intermediate-CDR (ICDR). For ozone datasets distributed here, both ICDR and CDR products are generated using common software and algorithms. The CDRs cover past time periods and include the sensors that are no longer in operation. They are meant to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change. The ICDRs are generated by satellite instruments still in operation, and are therefore regularly updated. Recent ICDR data are provided with a short-delay. They are expected to be consistent with the CDR baseline but have not undergone any extensive checking. Users are invited to read the documentation in order to determine the time coverage of each product.\nZonal averages and combined products obtained by merging data from different satellites are also provided. Nadir column data products from individual sensors are updated on a quarterly basis. All other products are updated once or twice a year.\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S based on algorithm developments performed as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Ozone Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project."}, "satellite-lai-fapar": {"title": "Leaf area index and fraction absorbed of photosynthetically active radiation 10-daily gridded data from 1981 to present", "description": "Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation: FAPAR corresponds to the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy. The FAPAR value results directly from the radiative transfer in the canopy which is instantaneous. It depends on canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties and illumination conditions. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models based on simple efficiency considerations. FAPAR is relatively linearly related to reflectance values and is little sensitive to scaling issues. Note also that the FAPAR refers only to the green parts of the canopy.\nLeaf area Index: LAI is defined as half the developed area of photosynthetically active elements of the vegetation per unit horizontal ground area. It determines the size of the interface for exchange of energy (including radiation) and mass between the canopy and the atmosphere. This is an intrinsic canopy primary variable that should not depend on observation conditions. LAI is strongly non-linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations is scale dependent. Note that vegetation LAI as estimated from remote sensing includes all the green contributors such as the understory when existing under forests canopies. However, except when using directional observations, LAI is not directly accessible from remote sensing observations due to the possible heterogeneity in leaf distribution within the canopy volume. Therefore, remote sensing observations are rather sensitive to the \u2018effective\u2019 leaf area index, i.e. the value that provides the same diffuse gap fraction while assuming a random distribution of leaves. The difference between the actual LAI and the effective LAI may be quantified by the clumping index that roughly varies between 0.5 (very clumped canopies) and 1.0 (randomly distributed leaves). Note that similarly to the other variables, the retrieved LAI is mainly corresponding to the green elements: the correct term to be used would be GAI (Green Area Index) although we propose to still use LAI for the sake of simplicity.\nThe following product versions are available:\n\nVersion v0.0 is a brokered dataset from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS).\nVersion v1.0 is produced by the C3S service. In this version, the theoretical framework for the CDR LAI and FAPAR algorithm capitalizes on the past experience gained in the Copernicus Global Land products (Baret et al. 2013). It capitalizes itself on the development and validation of already existing products: CYCLOPES Version 3.1 and MODIS Collection 5, and the use of neural networks. Verger et al. (2008) demonstrated that this approach could be used efficiently to estimate LAI and FAPAR from existing products provided that a strong link exists between the inputs and the outputs in the training dataset. Error propagation was included in the version v1.0 (compared to v0.0).\nVersion v2.0 is produced by the C3S service. This version is retrieved by applying the Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) to visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) broadband albedos. TIP is based on the Two-stream Model developed by Pinty et al. 2006, which implements the two-stream approximation of radiative transfer for a homogeneous canopy (\u201c1D-canopy\u201d).\nVersion v3.0 is produced by the C3S service. This version builds on version 2 and adds a multi-sensor aspect to the LAI/FAPAR products delivered so far. The inversion of the BRDF coefficients was improved. A climatological BRDF based on SPOT-VGT is introduced as a priori information used for the inversion of the albedos which is the input for the TIP model.\nVersion v4.0 is produced by the C3S service and builds on version 3 using the Sentinel3 A/B SLSTR and OLCI dataset.\n\nPlease note that LAI version v0.0 and v1.0 represent the actual LAI. Starting from version v2.0, the LAI produced by the TIP (Two Inversion Package) model represents the \"effective\" LAI. The difference between the actual LAI and the effective LAI may be quantified by the clumping index that roughly varies between 0.5 (very clumped canopies) and 1.0 (randomly distributed leaves)."}, "satellite-albedo": {"title": "Surface albedo 10-daily gridded data from 1981 to present", "description": "This dataset provides global Earth surface albedo products. The albedo has an impact on the amount of energy that Earth absorbs from the Sun and, therefore, is an important variable in climate and weather studies.\nThe surface albedo quantifies the fraction of irradiance reflected by the surface of the Earth. It provides information on the radiative basis, thus on the temperature and water balance. The directional albedo or directional-hemispherical reflectance (also called black-sky albedo) is defined as the integration of the bi-directional reflectance over the viewing hemisphere. It assumes all energy is coming from a direct radiation from the sun and is computed for the local solar noon.\nThe current algorithm is applied at a 10-day frequency on daily surface reflectances acquired during a moving temporal window of 20 days. It first normalizes the reflectances through inversion of a semi-empiric, kernel-driven reflectance model and favouring the most recent observations. Directional albedo is then computed, per spectral band, by integration over the viewing hemisphere and for local solar noon. Broadband albedo is then calculated from the spectral albedo by a linear relationship.\nMultiple platform/sensors were used offering various spatial resolution and temporal coverage (1 km from SPOT-VGT and PROBA-V, 4 km from AVHRR).

Tropospheric humidity profiles are retrieved using 1D variational assimilation of observed atmospheric refractivity profiles and background model information from the ECMWF reanalysis. Compared to other satellite observation techniques, RO observations have high vertical resolution and are not affected by clouds or the type of underlying surface (such as land and sea).\nThe RO retrievals are averaged in monthly and 5-degree latitude bands for altitudes below 12km which roughly covers the troposphere. The variability (standard deviation) within such monthly bins are also provided, as well as associated quantities such as observation counts, sampling errors and an estimate of the fraction of model information in the humidity retrievals. In addition, mean and variability are provided for humidity for the a priori ECMWF reanalysis data, sampled (i.e. collocated) similarly at the satellite observation locations. \nPlease note that the terms humidity and water vapour are used interchangeably on this page and in the documentation."}, "satellite-sea-level-global": {"title": "Sea level gridded data from satellite observations for the global ocean from 1993 to present", "description": "This dataset provides gridded daily and monthly mean global estimates of sea level anomaly based on satellite altimetry measurements. The rise in global mean sea level in recent decades has been one of the most important and well-known consequences of climate warming, putting a large fraction of the world population and economic infrastructure at greater risk of flooding. However, changes in the global average sea level mask regional variations that can be one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, it is essential to measure changes in sea level over the world\u2019s oceans as accurately as possible.\nSea level anomaly is defined as the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. In this dataset sea level anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012) using up-to-date altimeter standards.\nIn the past, the altimeter sea level datasets were distributed on the CNES AVISO altimetry portal until their production was taken over by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\nThe sea level dataset provided here by C3S is climate-oriented, that is, dedicated to the monitoring of the long-term evolution of sea level and the analysis of the ocean/climate indicators, both requiring a homogeneous and stable sea level record. To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes. The C3S sea level dataset is used to produce Ocean Monitoring Indicators (e.g. global and regional mean sea level evolution), available in the CMEMS catalogue.\nThe CMEMS sea level dataset has a more operational focus as it is dedicated to the retrieval of mesoscale signals in the context of ocean modeling and analysis of the ocean circulation on a global or regional scale. Such applications require the most accurate sea level estimates at each time step with the best spatial sampling of the ocean with all satellites available, with less emphasis on long-term stability and homogeneity.\nThis dataset is updated three times a year with a delay of about 5 months relative to present time. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, these processing and validation steps are essential to enhance the stability and accuracy of the sea level products and make them suitable for climate applications.\nThis dataset includes estimates of sea level anomaly and absolute dynamic topography together with the corresponding geostrophic velocities, which provide an approximation of the ocean surface currents.

Glaciers play a fundamental role in the Earth\u2019s water cycles. They are one of the most important freshwater resources for societies and ecosystems and the recent increase in ice melt contributes directly to the rise of ocean levels. Due to this they have been declared as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by GCOS, the Global Climate Observing System. Within the Copernicus Services, the global gridded annual glacier mass change dataset provides information on changing glacier resources by combining glacier change observations from the Fluctuations of Glaciers (FoG) database that is brokered from World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).\nInspired by previous methodological frameworks, a new approach was developed to combine the glacier mass balance and elevation change observations, providing a new and unique product of annual glacier mass change and related uncertainties for every hydrological year since 1975/76 distributed on a 0.5\u00b0 global regular grid. The present dataset bridges the gap regarding the spatio-temporal coverage of glacier change observations, providing for the first time in the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS) an annually resolved glacier mass change product using the glacier elevation change sample as calibration. This goal has become feasible at the global scale thanks to a new globally near-complete (96% of the world glaciers) dataset of glacier elevation change observations ingested by the FoG database.\nTo develop the distributed glacier change product, the use of glacier outlines from the C3S Glacier Area product version 2 are used. A glacier is considered to belong to a grid-point when its geometric centroid lies within the grid point. The centroid is obtained from the glacier outlines from the C3S Glacier Area product version 2. The glacier changes in Gt correspond to the total mass of water lost/gained over the glacier surface during a given year. Note that to propagate to mm/cm/m of water column on the grid cell, the grid cell area needs to be considered. Note that hydrological year vary on the Southern Hemisphere (October to September next year) and Northern Hemispheres (April to March next year). The annual distributed glacier change dataset cannot resolve for this seasonal difference and is important for the user to account for them when using the datasets.

Cloud properties describe the state of the Earth\u00b4s upper-air atmosphere. Clouds have an effect on weather and climate through their contribution to the Earth\u2019s water cycle and impact on the Earth\u2019s energy budget. They influence the motion of the atmosphere on many scales and modify the atmospheric composition. By accumulating and carrying the evaporated and transpired water in the atmosphere, clouds redistribute water over the globe, which often involves precipitation. Further, the variable cloud properties determines the feedback mechanism that clouds have on the hydrological cycle, directly in terms of precipitation, but also indirectly on the Earth\u00b4s energy budget by interacting with radiation fluxes. Usually, clouds reflect more solar radiation back to space than the underlying surface and absorb and re-emit infrared (IR) radiation, leading to less IR radiation leaving the system than without clouds. According to the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report, clouds (together with aerosols) contribute the largest uncertainty to the estimates of the Earth\u00b4s energy budget, as well as to the potential feedback mechanisms and responses to climate change.\nThe ECV Cloud Properties contains four main variables, which can be separated into averaged cloudiness, cloud height products and cloud physical properties for ice and liquid water phase.

SRB represents the balance between the heating of the surface through incoming solar radiation and cooling through the emission of infra-red radiation which is a fundamental component of the surface energy budget. Small changes in the surface radiation budget can lead to large climatological responses, which makes a permanent and precise monitoring indispensable. Accurate understanding of the surface radiation budget at regional and global scales can improve the understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate system and supports research on current and anticipated climate change, as well as the evaluation of radiative processes in climate models. Better knowledge of the global and regional surface radiation budget is also required for a successful utilization of renewable energy sources, such as solar power plants.\nThe dataset contains seven variables which can be separated into solar (shortwave) and thermal (longwave) surface radiation components. Both components include incoming (downwelling), outgoing (upwelling), and the net radiation fluxes. These variables were produced by two \u201cproduct families\u201d, based on the data from different sensors and algorithms that cover the same seven variables.\nThe two families follow somewhat different nomenclatures. To help the user to navigate the different names, a table relating the names used in the download form with the names used within the files and in other datasets distributed by the Climate Data Store is added at the end of this overview. The fact that the naming is different reflects the fact that each family was originated by different projects within different organisations at different times.

Instantaneous satellite observations are used to derive a spatio-temporal averaged data record. The data are available as twice daily (one for the ascending and the other for the descending passes) averages on a regular latitude/longitude grid. Additionally, the daily mean UTH is provided as a weighted average of ascending and descending orbits for all the grid points with valid ascending and descending observations.\nUTH is the Jacobian weighted relative humidity in the upper troposphere. Its natural logarithm can be expressed as a linear function of the radiance emanated from water vapour emissions in the upper troposphere, expressed as brightness temperature. Various threshold masks are applied in order to identify and remove measurements contaminated by clouds, for example due to scattering by large ice particles in the presence of deep convection, and measurements contaminated by the surface. A viewing angle dependent analytical equation is used to convert off-nadir brightness temperatures into nadir equivalents, thereby providing a correction for limb darkening effects.\nUTH is part of the Water Vapour ECV inventory in the CDS together with Total Column Water Vapour and Tropospheric Humidity Profiles.

The energy indicators are electricity demand and power generation from various sources: wind (both onshore and offshore), solar and hydro (run-of-river and reservoir) power. Depending on the indicator, the data are available at the national, regional and grid (approximately 30x30 km) level for most European countries. The spatial aggregation of data over land uses the Eurostat NUTS0 & NUTS2 (Nomenclature des unit\u00e9s territoriales statistiques, 2016) regions. The offshore variables (e.g. offshore wind power) use the European maritime region definitions MAR0 and MAR1. Further information on the NUTS and MAR regions can be found in the documentation.\nThe C3S Energy operational service is composed of three main streams: historical (1979-present), seasonal forecasts and projections (typically covering the period 1970-2100). This historical dataset (1979-present) produces reference climate variables based on the ERA5 reanalysis. Energy variables are generated by transforming the climate variables using a combination of statistical models and physically based data. A comprehensive set of measured energy supply and demand data has been collected from various sources such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). These data provide a crucial reference to assess the robustness of the models used to convert climate into electric energy variables.\nData is provided for the European domain, in a multi-variable, multi-timescale view of the climate and energy systems.

Essential climate variables are generated with the UERRA-HARMONIE and the MESCAN-SURFEX systems. UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidity at 2 meters above the model topography.\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows taking full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.\nIn general, reanalysis combines model data with observations into a complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (6 hours in the UERRA-HARMONIE system) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. \nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. UERRA-HARMONIE data is available from 1961 and is updated once a month with a delay to real-time of about 4 months. The system provides four analyses per day \u2013 at 0 UTC, 6 UTC, 12 UTC, and 18 UTC. Between the analyses, forecasts of the system are available with hourly resolution. Hence, estimates of the status of the atmosphere are available for every hour since 1961. Moreover, forecasts up to 30 hours are available from the analyses initialised at 0 UTC and 12 UTC.\nIn addition to observations in the model domain, a regional reanalysis needs information at its lateral boundaries. For the UERRA-HARMONIE system, this information is taken from the global reanalyses ERA40 (until the end of 1978) and ERA-interim (from 1979). The improvement over global products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details, e.g. topography. Moreover, it enables the system even to consider more observations at places with dense observation networks. The UERRA-HARMONIE regional reanalysis is produced at a horizontal resolution of 11km and MESCAN SURFEX provides data at a resolution of 5.5km.\nFor the UERRA-HARMONIE system, variables are produced at the surface and on model levels (65 levels) but are also interpolated to two other level types: pressure levels (24 levels between 1000-10hPa), and height levels (11 levels between 15m-500m). The output of height levels were introduced with special focus on the wind energy sector and their needs. Soil data is available on 14 levels from the surface to a depth of 12m. The number of available parameters varies between the different level types.\nIn order to make data access more manageable, the UERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX dataset has been split into four records. Analysis time steps are available via the CDS whereas forecasts are available only through CDSAPI."}, "projections-cordex-domains-single-levels": {"title": "CORDEX regional climate model data on single levels", "description": "This catalogue entry provides Regional Climate Model (RCM) data on single levels from a number of experiments, models, domains, resolutions, ensemble members, time frequencies and periods computed over several regional domains all over the World in the framework of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The term \"single levels\" is used to express that the variables are 2D-matrices computed on one vertical level which can be surface (or a level close to the surface) or a dedicated pressure level in the atmosphere. Multiple vertical levels are excluded from this catalogue entry.\nHigh-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) can provide climate change information on regional and local scales in relatively fine detail, which cannot be obtained from coarse scale Global Climate Models (GCMs). This is manifested in better description of small-scale regional climate characteristics and also in more accurate representation of extreme events. Consequently, outputs of such RCMs are indispensable in supporting regional and local climate impact studies and adaptation decisions. RCMs are not independent from the GCMs, since the GCMs provide lateral and lower boundary conditions to the regional models. In that sense RCMs can be viewed as magnifying glasses of the GCMs.\nThe CORDEX experiments consist of RCM simulations representing different future socio-economic scenarios (forcings), different combinations of GCMs and RCMs and different ensemble members of the same GCM-RCM combinations. This experiment design through the ensemble members allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change. These uncertainties come from differences in the scenarios of future socio-economic development, the imperfection of regional and global models used and the internal (natural) variability of the climate system. This experiment design allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change:\n\nwhat will future climate forcing be?\nwhat will be the response of the climate system to changes in forcing?\nwhat is the uncertainty related to natural variability of the climate system?\n\nThe term \"experiment\" in the CDS form refers to three main categories:\n\nEvaluation: CORDEX experiment driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis for a past period.

Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. These experiments, that follow the observed changes in climate forcing, show how the RCMs perform for the past climate when forced by GCMs and can be used as a reference period for comparison with scenario runs for the future. The period covered is typically 1950-2005;\nScenario: Ensemble of CORDEX climate projection experiments using RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) forcing scenarios. These scenarios are the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios providing different pathways of the future climate forcing. Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. The period covered is typically 2006-2100.\n\nIn CORDEX, the same experiments were done using different RCMs (labelled as \u201cRegional Climate Model\u201d in the CDS form).\nIn addition, for each RCM, there is a variety of GCMs, which can be used as lateral boundary conditions. The GCMs used are coming from the CMIP5 (5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) archive. These GCM boundary conditions are labelled as \u201cGlobal Climate Model\u201d in the form and are also available in the CDS.\nAdditionally, the uncertainty related to internal variability of the climate system is sampled by running several simulations with the same RCM-GCM combination. On the forms, these are indexed as separate ensemble members (the naming convention for ensemble members is available in the documentation). For each GCM, the same experiment was repeatedly done using slightly different conditions (like initial conditions or different physical parameterisations for instance) producing in that way an ensemble of experiments closely related. More details behind these sequential ensemble numbers is available in the detailed documentation.\nThe data are produced by the institutes and modelling centres participating in the different CORDEX domains with partial support from different international and national contributions including support from COPERNICUS for some of the EURO-CORDEX runs.\nThe data can be used for commercial purposes (unrestricted use) with the exception of the simulations from the following RCMs: BOUN-RegCM4-3 model (for Central Asia and Middle East and North Africa domains) and RU-CORE-RegCM4-3 model (for South-East Asia domain).
